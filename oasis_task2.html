            <p style="padding-left: 3%;color:white">Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was born on  23 January,1897
                 in Cuttack, Orissa and he died on 18 August,1945, in a hospital in Taiwan after suffering from burn
                  injuries sustained in a plane crash.<br>
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 3%;color:white">Subhas Chandra Bose studied in Calcutta (Kolkata) at the 
                Presidency College and the Scottish Churches College. His parents then sent him to the University of
                 Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service<br>
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 3%;color:white">
                As a child Netaji was a great academic success and was selected for the prestigious ICS in early 20th
                century when very few Indians could get into the prestigious civil services. Now this is what we call 
                an irony in a person's life, patriotic Bose could not work under the British yoke, it seemed proposterous
                 to him
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 3%;color:white"> He was a freedom fighter and was deeply influenced by the teachings of S
                wami Vivekananda. He gave the famous quote “Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom”. Netaji was an active me
                mber of the Indian National Congress. He was elected as the President of the All India Youth Congress in 1923..  <br>
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 3%;color:white">
                Netaji was a true nationalist and patriot who adopted a different route to get freedom for his country and
                as his "methods" were different from those of the leaders like Mahatma Gandhi , JL Nehru and others, it is
                generally believed that he had no love lost for them. Thus the bond shared by two staunch nationalists that
                is Mahatma Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose is generally ignored.<br>
